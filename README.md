## Introduction

Understanding customer sentiments through reviews is crucial for businesses. This project aims to analyze Amazon reviews to uncover insights about customer opinions, identify common themes, and visualize frequently mentioned words and phrases using word clouds.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of Amazon customer reviews. You can download a sample dataset from:

- [Amazon Customer Reviews (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)

Place the dataset in the `data/` directory. Make sure to preprocess the data to suit your analysis needs.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- WordCloud
- [Any other libraries or tools you used]

## Key Components

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the text data for analysis (removing punctuation, converting to lowercase, etc.).
2. **Tokenization**: Breaking down the text into individual words or tokens for analysis.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing customer sentiments to categorize reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
4. **Word Cloud Generation**: Creating visual representations of the most frequently used words in the reviews.

You can find the implementation details in the `src/` directory.

## Usage

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
  git@github.com:Dipesh30/NLP_Amazon_customer_reviews.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd amazon-review-analysis
Install the required packages:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prepare your dataset and place it in the data/ directory.
Run the analysis script:
bash
Copy code
python analyze_reviews.py
The script will preprocess the data, perform tokenization, and generate word clouds for visualization.
